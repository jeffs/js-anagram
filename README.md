# Anagram Finder

Enter text in the box, press the button (or the Enter key), and (eventually) see a list of anagrams.

## To Do

* Transform the code into a sequence of asynchronous transformations.  The
  `findAnagrams` function is currently synchronous and non-tail recursive.
* Display anagrams as they are found, rather than all at once.
* Transform and filter results to include only grammatically correct phrases.
* Improve performance, especially for long input strings.
